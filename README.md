# RNN_MPS_implement
Apple MPS implementation to Recurrent Neural Networks

In this code, we train a model with Apple MPS backend for a chatbot project.
Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus was used for dialog training. 
Although we have obtained the first models, the training process continues. 
A training iteration takes 8 hours with the M1 Pro chipset (CPU + GPU).
